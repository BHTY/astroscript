# astroscript
AstroScript is a basic scripting language inspired by the UNIX CSh/CShell, with some cues from Lua and QBasic as well. It is currently in an early alpha stage. The main features it is currently lacking include.
- More "shell"-like features
- Assignment to multidimensional array indices
- For loops
